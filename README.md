A simple graphical sorter written in Python with Pygame where you can visualize many algorithms and see how they actually work.

You can adjust the speed using <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> or <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> and shuffle the array at the end of the sorting to restart the algorithm by pressing <kbd>SPACE</kbd>. Finally, press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit.

I will add more algorithms when I have time.

## How to use

Just launch the `main.py`, choose your algorithm and the size of the array to sort.
When the Pygame window gets opened, press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to start the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7.0+

Get a copy of the Project. Assuming you have git installed, open your Terminal and enter:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/marcpinet/epidemic-modeling.git'
```

To install all needed requirements run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running üèÉ

After that you can proceed to start the program by running `main.py`.

## TO-DO List

<ul>
    <li>Improve the height/width guess of the rods so I will be able to increase the max size of the array to sort.</li>
</ul>
